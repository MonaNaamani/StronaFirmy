# Find out how We Can Help You Adapt Your Site or App to the Regulations

Websites and apps must always comply with certain requirements imposed by law. Failure to comply with the legal requirements, can result in serious penalties including substantial fines, audits and potential litigation.

For this reason **we have chosen to rely on iubenda**, a company built on both legal and technical expertise, that specializes in this sector. Together with iubenda, of which we are Certified Partners, we have developed a proposal to offer all our customers a simple and safe solution to their compliance needs.

## Overview of the Main Legal Requirements for Websites and Apps Owners

### Privacy and Cookie Policy

The law obliges each site/app that collects personal data to **disclose relevant details to users via dedicated privacy and cookie notices**.

Privacy policies must contain certain fundamental elements specific to your particular processing activities, including:

- the contact and identifying details of the data controller;
- which personal data is being processed;
- the purposes and methods of processing;
- the categories of sources from which consumers' data is being collected;
- the legal bases of processing (e.g., consent);
- the third-parties that may also access the data - this includes any third-party tools (e.g., Google Analytics);
- details relating to the transfer of data outside the European Union (where it applies);
- the rights of the user;
- description of notification process for changes or updates to the privacy policy;
- the effective date of the privacy policy.

The cookie policy specifically describes the different types of cookies installed through the site, any third-parties to which these cookies refer – including a link to the respective documents and opt-out forms – and the purposes of the processing.

**_Can't we use a generic document?_** It's not possible to use generic documents as your policy must **describe in detail the specific data processing carried out by your site/app**, and must also include the particular details of any third-party technologies (e.g., facebook Like buttons or Google Maps) specifically used by you.

**_What if my site does not process any data?_** It's very difficult for your site not to process any data. A simple contact form or a traffic analysis system such as Google Analytics is enough to trigger the obligation to prepare and display a privacy and cookie policy.

### EU Cookie Law

In addition to providing an easily available and accurate cookie policy, **in order to adapt a website to the cookie law, it is also necessary to show an informative cookie banner which links to a detailed cookie policy at the first visit of each user, giving the user the opportunity to either reject or grant consent to the installation of cookies**. Most types of cookies, including those issued by tools such as social sharing buttons, should only be released after the user have provided a valid consent.

Furthermore, many third-party vendor networks may limit ad reach if you do not have a cookie management system that meets industry standards in place - potentially reducing your ability to generate ad revenue.

**_What is a cookie?_** Cookies are small files used to store or track certain information while a user browses a site. Cookies are now essential to the proper functioning of a site. In addition, many third-party technologies that we integrate into our sites, such as simple video widgets or analytics programs, also use cookies.

### CCPA

CCPA requires that businesses **inform California users about how and why their data is being used, their rights in regards to this and how they can exercise these rights** – including the right to opt-out. In order to comply with these requirements, you need to include both the relevant disclosures within your privacy policy and display a notice of collection at the first user's visit (where applicable).

**The process which allows the user to opt-out should be facilitated via a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" (DNSMPI) link** which should be accessible from your notice of collection and elsewhere on your site (best practice would be to also include the link in the footer).

_**My business is not based in California, do I need to comply with CCPA?**_ The CCPA applies to most businesses that collect or could potentially collect Californian customers personal information, whether or not the business itself is geographically located in California. Since IP addresses are considered personal information, this likely applies to any website with at least 50,000 unique visits per year from California.

### Consent according to GDPR and LGPD

When a user directly enters personal data on a site/app, for example by filling in a contact form, service registration or newsletter subscription, it is necessary to **collect consent that is freely given, specific and informed. Under the GDPR, it's also necessary to keep unambiguous records that allow you to demonstrate that valid consent was collected**.

Similar to the GDPR, **the Brazilian LGPD also requires the data controller to provide an unambiguous proof of consent**, giving evidence that the user's consent was collected by a valid means.

**_What is free, specific and informed consent?_** You must obtain consent for each specific processing purpose – for example, a consent to send newsletters and another consent to send promotional material on behalf of third-parties. Consent may be requested by setting up one or more checkboxes that are not pre-selected, not mandatory or coerced (freely given) and accompanied by relevant disclosures that make it clear to the user how his or her data will be used.

**_How can proof of valid consent be demonstrated unambiguously?_** A range of information must be collected each time a user fills in a form on your site/app. This information includes a unique user identification code, the content of the privacy policy accepted, a copy of the form submitted by the user as well as a record of the opt-in mechanism used.

**_Is the email I receive from the user as a result of filling out a form not sufficient as proof of consent?_** Unfortunately, it is not sufficient, as some information necessary to reconstruct the suitability of the procedure for collecting consent is missing, such as a copy of the form actually completed by the user and the version of the privacy documents available to the user at the time the consent was collected.

**_Do I have to comply with the LGPD even if my organization is not based in Brazil?_** The LGPD has a territorial scope that extends outside of Brazil. This means that you may have to comply even if you or your business are not based in Brazil. Therefore, you fall under the LGPD scope if you process data from individuals located within the Brazilian territory, regardless of their nationality (even if they were in Brazil only at the time of data collection, and have since moved).

### Terms and Conditions

In certain circumstances it can be necessary to protect your online business from potential liabilities with a Terms and Conditions document. Though not always legally required, **Terms and Conditions set the way in which your product, service or content may be used, in a legally binding way.**

The Terms and Conditions typically contain copyright clauses, disclaimers, terms of sale, allow you to set governing law, list mandatory consumer protection clauses, and more.

The Terms and Conditions should at least include:

- the identification of the business;
- a description of the service that your site/app provides;
- information on risk allocation, liability, and disclaimers;
- warranty/guarantee information;
- the existence of a withdrawal right;
- safety information, including instructions for proper use (e.g., terms of delivery of product/service);
- rights of use;
- conditions of use/purchase (e.g., age requirements or location-based restrictions);
- refund policy/exchange/termination of service and related information;
- information related to methods of payment.

_**When is it mandatory to have Terms and Conditions?**_ Everyone from bloggers to e-commerce, SaaS, and enterprise businesses can benefit from setting Terms of Use. However, in some cases it can be mandatory, such as in the case of e-commerce, where payment data is processed.

_**Can I copy and use a Terms and Conditions document from another site?**_ Because they are essentially a legally binding agreement, it is not only important to have one in place, but also necessary to ensure that it meets legal requirements and it matches your specific business processes, model, and remains up-to-date with the various laws referenced in its contents. Copy-pasting Terms and Conditions from other sites is very risky and could result in the document being void or unenforceable.
